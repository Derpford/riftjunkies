# Rift Junkies
## A game of deadly combat and strange magics
"So you want to be a Rift Junkie, eh?" the orcish woman at the desk says, nodding. "You've got your licensing fee? Good. But be warned--this is no job for the faint of heart. Those Rifts may spit out the Luminite that makes our world run the way it does, but each one changes everything around it--mutating the wild beasts, twisting the terrain, even making anybody unlucky enough to be nearby..." She gestures to her green-tinted skin, covered in odd patches of fur. "You know."
"Just pick a weapon and find someone to watch your back. New rifts open all the time. And try to remember to cut and run when you can."

## What is Rift Junkies?
It's a simple RPG about mysterious Rifts, unknowable structures that appear out of nowhere, turn the landscape into something barely recognizable, and then begin spewing a powerful material called Luminite. While a Rift is still functioning, wild creatures near it are mutated into strange beasts, which growl and hiss and seek to destroy the Rift and end their suffering. Your job is to hold the line so that you can cash in the Luminite you gather from the Rift.
